        <h3>Profile</h3>
        <p>
         I am at the beginning of my coding journey when it comes to putting skills I have studied into practice but I am a person who is committed to putting in the hours to develop skills and experience to become the best asset I possibly can be to the company. I am currently in the process of building and upscaling my skills to delve into the development sector - consistently working on myself and pushing further to learn more coding languages and build upon QA skills I have learned in a previous field to cater to a development setting.
